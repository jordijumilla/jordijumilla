# 🚀 About Me:
As of october 2024, I'm working as a simulation development engineer at McLaren Racing, in the UK. I studied a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) - BarcelonaTech.

I did my thesis in the heliophysics (i.e. solar physics) research group of NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre (Maryland, US). I developed a Python script that performs the Grad-Shafanov Reconstruction Technique (GSRT) for magnetic flux ropes. The repository is not public at the moment, but I plan to finish the work in a few months.
